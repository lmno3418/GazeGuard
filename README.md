## Project Overview

The Python Face Recognition Attendance System is designed to:
1. Recognize faces in real time using the device's camera.
2. Record attendance and arrival times in an Excel sheet.
3. Generate daily attendance summaries for review.

This project features a smart and efficient face matching algorithm, optimizing attendance recording while securely storing data in Excel files.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries**: `face_recognition`, `cv2` (OpenCV), `numpy`, `os`, `pandas`, `datetime`, and `openpyxl`
- **File Storage**: `gazeguard_photos` for known faces and `gazeguard_attendance` for daily Excel attendance records.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-attendance.git
    cd face-recognition-attendance
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy pandas openpyxl
    ```
3. Add images of known faces in the `gazeguard_photos` folder (create it if it doesnâ€™t exist).

---

## Usage

1. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2. The system will:
   - Capture live video.
   - Recognize faces and mark attendance in an Excel file under `gazeguard_attendance`.
3. End the program by closing the video window or pressing 'q'.

## Example Code
```python
import face_recognition
import cv2
import numpy as np
import os
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
from openpyxl import Workbook, load_workbook

# Full code is available in the main.py file.
```
